OVERVIEW
The Two-Way Traffic Application is designed to manage and optimize traffic flow on roadways that accommodate bi-directional vehicular movement. This application aims to enhance traffic efficiency, reduce congestion, and improve safety for drivers and pedestrians by utilizing advanced algorithms and real-time data analysis.

KEY FEATURES:

REAL-TIME TRAFFIC MONITORING
Live Traffic Data: Collects data from various sources such as GPS devices, traffic cameras, and sensors embedded in the road infrastructure.

Traffic Density Analysis: Analyzes the number of vehicles and their speed in both directions to determine traffic density.

ADAPTIVE TRAFFIC SIGNAL CONTROL
Dynamic Signal Timing: Adjusts traffic light timings based on real-time traffic conditions to optimize flow and minimize wait times.

Emergency Vehicle Priority: Provides priority passage for emergency vehicles by adjusting traffic signals accordingly.

ROUTE OPTIMIZATION
Alternative Route Suggestions: Provides drivers with alternative routes in case of heavy traffic, road closures, or accidents.
